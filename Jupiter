Jupiter 4  moons: Ganymede Callisto Io Europa

The planets equatorial clouds take 18 hours to complete one rotation. The
reason this happens is that Jupiter  does not have a solid body.

Juno, a probe sent by NASA in 2011, has recently entered Jupiter's orbit.
It will study Jupiter's atmosphere to better understand planet formation.
